**Popitairy** is a pop-up event organizer to reduce the underlying work of pop-ups.

## Background

Pop-ups became very popular worldwide since a few years and are an effective way for event hosts to save costs and to grow their networks and outreach. Pop-ups are enabled as a selling point within an existing event and/or space. While self-made professionals rely on a regular income for them and their famillies pop-ups are also a great way for initiatives/groups to collaborate in order to raise awareness and donations for a good cause.

When runnning a pop-up usually event hosts face challenges on:

- Venue Search => send inquiries, ask friends and partners, book venues
- Equipment / Products => build partnerships with suppliers to rent, buy or organize equipment, etc.
- Logistics => plan staff, delivery and pick-up
- Networking => research, handle feedback, outreach
- Marketing => word-of-mouth, social media, mailing lists, kitchen table
